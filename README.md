# Multimeter
SJTU EE333 Final Project: Course Design in Intelligent Instrument, tested on CCS

* Built a digital multimeter system via circuit welding, software controlling by C Language in Code Composer
Studio (CCS) and hardware controlling by MSP430 Single-chip Microcomputer (SCM).
* Realized the functions of multirange DC/AC voltmeter with deviation of ±1%, frequency meter and
multirange capacitance meter with deviation of ±5%.
